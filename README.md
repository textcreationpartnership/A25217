1. To the WORTHY GENTLEMEN Engag'd in the SOCIETIES FOR Reformation of Manners.

1. A SERMON Preached to the SOCIETIES FOR Reformation of Manners.

    _ OBSERVATION.
The case of a People is deplorable and almost desperate, when they are so universally corrupted, and their Corruptions so obstinate that they will not obey the most proper and potent Means of Reformation.

      * I. When the Case of a People may be said to be Deplorable, and whence it is that their Corruptions become so incurable.

      * II. What is it that renders the Case of a People so deplorable when their Corruptions are become incurable?

      * III. I am now come to the Third and and Last Inquiry, What may be further done (if any thing may yet be done) when inveterate Corruptions, universal Degeneracy seems to have made the Evils incurable: And this has brought me to
The APPLICATION.

I. Let me intreat you to look into your own hearts, and when you have narrowly made a Scrutiny there, and found all right within, or set that right which was wrong, you may more comfortably look upwards to your God, and more couragiously outwards upon all the Oppositions and Discouragements, you shall meet with in your Blessed Work, from this wretched World.

II. Let me now encourage you to look upwards: which you may now comfortably

and confidently do, when you have faithfully and impartially inspected your own hearts: And

III. I shall not need to advise you to look outwards to that Treatment you are

to expect from those Flagitious Ones, whose Crimes call for your most severe Animadversion. I hope you have fate down and reckon'd it up with your selves what it might cost your before you enter'd upon, and engaged in this Work, yet I will present you with a Bill of Fate of the Entertainment which I believe you have found, and may further expect.

IV. Give me so much more of your Patience, whilst I set before you the Encouragements of God, against all these Discouragements, and I will conclude.
